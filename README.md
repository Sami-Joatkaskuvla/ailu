This place contains some written code.
Movement.Php is a javascript game i created in school.
The controls include: W A S D MOUSE1 MOUSE2 SPACE I O (And some other controls i probably forgot to mention)
Too lazy to start explaining what each control does.

The animation testing file is a proof of concept for animations working on javascript canvas. 
Now the only problem is making individual animations for each enemy in the javascript game
